### Check out both of our portfolio websites [Brody](brodybillings.ca) and [Gio](giovanniperruzzi.com) for more of our individual works.

This is the "for fun" project for our portfolios and to gain more experience with new frameworks etc.
<br>

A brief summary. This is a mock clothing brand where we will use AI to generate a random name for us to create and establish a full brand around. This will include things like Logos, Brand Guidelines, Sample Clothing and a full website utilizing Vue, React and Lumen/Laravel (the checklist can be found on the [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15c6o5t0odhArYeH4dMaCcP_oMHiB8ezTmzyfTSMjBlI/edit?usp=sharing) on 07/07/2023).
